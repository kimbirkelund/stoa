# Documentation conventions

Authoritative rules for how requirements are identified and organized. All
docs under `docs/` follow these.

## Requirement identifiers

Every requirement and constraint has a **stable ID**. IDs are referenced from
acceptance scenarios and never reused once retired.

| ID form | Scope       | Kind                                                      | Acceptance test? |
| ------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `C-N`   | Global      | Non-functional **c**onstraint                             | No               |
| `X-N`   | Global      | **C**ross-cutting behavioral requirement (spans features) | Yes              |
| `R-N`   | Global      | Behavioral **r**equirement (not tied to one feature)      | Yes              |
| `RF-N`  | Feature `F` | Feature behavioral **r**equirement                        | Yes              |

- **Kind-first letter.** The leading letter states the kind (`R` requirement,
  `C` constraint, `X` cross-cutting), so global `R-N` and feature `RF-N` both
  read as "this is a requirement" at a glance.
- **`F` is a feature code** — see below. Example: in the `workspace-launcher`
  feature (code `WL`), requirements are `RWL-1`, `RWL-2`, …
- **No feature-level cross-cutting (`XF-N`).** Cross-cutting is global _by
  definition_ — a concern spanning features. A concern scoped to one feature is
  just an `RF-N`.
- **Feature-level constraints** are not used yet. If a non-functional property
  scoped to a single feature ever arises, it would take the form `CF-N`; until
  then, treat all constraints as global `C-N`.
- **Bare `R-N` is reserved for true global requirements** (currently none).
  Behavior that belongs to a feature uses `RF-N`, even if that feature is the
  only one that exists.

## Feature codes

Each feature has a **2-character uppercase code**, unique across all features.

- Registered in [`features/_index.md`](features/_index.md) (the `Code` column).
- Declared in the feature's own `_index.md`.
- Used to form that feature's requirement IDs (`RF-N`).

| Feature            | Code |
| ------------------ | ---- |
| Shell              | `SH` |
| Workspaces         | `WS` |
| Workspace launcher | `WL` |
| Projects           | `PJ` |

(The registry in `features/_index.md` is the source of truth; this table is
illustrative.)

## EARS pattern tags

Each behavioral requirement is tagged with its EARS pattern —
`(ubiquitous)`, `(event)`, `(state)`, `(unwanted)`, `(optional)`, or
`(complex)`. Tags are orthogonal to the ID scheme. A requirement may also be
tagged `deferred` when it depends on a capability not yet targeted; note what it
depends on.

## Organization

- Global [constraints](constraints.md) (`C-*`), [cross-cutting
  requirements](cross-cutting.md) (`X-*`), and [definitions](definitions.md)
  live at the top level.
- Feature-specific requirements live under `docs/features/<name>/`.
- Every directory has an `_index.md`; read it first.
